### About me

My name is Ulrich Steinwandel but I go by Ulli. I am a theoretical astropysicist and I successfully defended my PhD-thesis in October 2020 at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, working with Dr. Benjamin P. Moster, Dr. Thorsten Naab and Dr. Klaus Dolag. Currently, I am a Flatiron Research Fellow (FRF) at the Center for Computational Astropysics (CCA) at the Flatiron Institute in New York. I work closely with Dr. Rachel Somerville, Dr. Greg Bryan and Dr. Christopher C. Hayward on numerical simulations ranging from galaxy-clusters and the Intracluster medium (ICM) over Milky Way-like disc galaxies down to resolved star-by-star dwarf galaxy models that can sucessfully resolve the ISM on sub-parsec scales. Hereby, I put a special focus on understanding the origin and emergence of the magnetic field structure in the ICM, the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the ISM. Additionally, to my expertise on magnetic fields on all scale in the Unviverse, I carry out work on simulations with a direct dust component in close collaboration with Dr. Philip Hopkins at Caltech, extending my range down to the smallest scales in the ISM that boarder planet formation.
