## Welcome to the Webpage of Dr. Ulrich Philipp Steinwandel!

My Name is Ulrich Steinwandel but I go by Ulli. If you are interested to talk to me about my research or collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me at usteinwandel@flatironinstitute.org 

## About me

I am a theoretical astropysicist and I successfully defended my PhD-thesis in October 2020 at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, working with Dr. Benjamin P. Moster, Dr. Thorsten Naab and Dr. Klaus Dolag. Currently, I am a Flatiron Research Fellow (FRF) at the Center for Computational Astropysics (CCA) at the Flatiron Institute in New York. I work closely with Dr. Rachel Somerville, Dr. Greg Bryan and Dr. Christopher C. Hayward on numerical simulations ranging from galaxy-clusters and the Intracluster medium (ICM) over Milky Way-like disc galaxies down to resolved star-by-star dwarf galaxy models that can sucessfully resolve the ISM on sub-parsec scales. Hereby, I put a special focus on understanding the origin and emergence of the magnetic field structure in the ICM, the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the ISM. Additionally, to my expertise on magnetic fields on all scale in the Unviverse, I carry out work on simulations with a direct dust component in close collaboration with Dr. Philip Hopkins at Caltech, extending my range down to the smallest scales in the ISM that boarder planet formation.

## Research

### Magnetic field amplifcation in Milky Way-like galaxies I: The small-scale-turbulent dynamo

Magnetic field amplification galaxies is a highly complicated topic. However, in recent years direct numerical MHD simualtions of galaxies with cooling and star formation have enabled a new way of studying magnetic field amplifcation in the Universe besides the excellent analtyical work provided by classical mean field dynamo theory (e.g. Ruzmaikin, Sokoloff and SHukurov 1988). Recent, breakthrough in numerical simulations allows for ab-initio models for magnetic field growth in galaxies showing overwhelming evidence by many different groups that magnetic fields in galaxies can be quickly amplified by the small-scale turbulent dynamo on rather short timescale compared to the dynamical time. In Steinwandel et. al. (2019) we studied the magnetic field amplification in Milky Way-like galaxies by means of the small-scale turbulent dynamo in great detail. We evlauted the presence of the small-scale trubulent dynamo by the shape of the magnetic power-spectra that take the predicted slope of k^{3/2} of Kazantsev 1967. Furthermore, we quantified the dynamo for the first time in galaxy simulation by computing the correlation between magnetic field strength and magnetic curvature and find excellent agreement with the high-resolution predcitions from Schkochihin et al. (2004).
