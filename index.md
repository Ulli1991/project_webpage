## Welcome to the Webpage of Dr. Ulrich Philipp Steinwandel!

My Name is Ulrich Steinwandel but I go by Ulli. I am Flatiron Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA) in New York. At CCA I am involved in the CAMELS and SMAUG collaboration. If you are interested to talk to me about my research or collaborating with me, please feel free to contact me at usteinwandel@flatironinstitute.org 

## About me

I am a theoretical astropysicist and I successfully defended my PhD-thesis in October 2020 at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, working with Dr. Benjamin P. Moster, Dr. Thorsten Naab and Dr. Klaus Dolag. Currently, I am a Flatiron Research Fellow (FRF) at the Center for Computational Astropysics (CCA) at the Flatiron Institute in New York. I work closely with Dr. Rachel Somerville, Dr. Greg Bryan and Dr. Christopher C. Hayward on numerical simulations ranging from galaxy-clusters and the Intracluster medium (ICM) over Milky Way-like disc galaxies down to resolved star-by-star dwarf galaxy models that can sucessfully resolve the ISM on sub-parsec scales. Hereby, I put a special focus on understanding the origin and emergence of the magnetic field structure in the ICM, the intergalactic medium (IGM) and the ISM. Additionally, to my expertise on magnetic fields on all scale in the Unviverse, I carry out work on simulations with a direct dust component in close collaboration with Dr. Philip Hopkins at Caltech, extending my range down to the smallest scales in the ISM that boarder planet formation.

## Research (peer reviewed and submitted)

### Magnetic field amplifcation in Milky Way-like galaxies I: The small-scale-turbulent dynamo

Magnetic field amplification galaxies is a highly complicated topic. However, in recent years direct numerical MHD simualtions of galaxies with cooling and star formation have enabled a new way of studying magnetic field amplifcation in the Universe besides the excellent analtyical work provided by classical mean field dynamo theory (e.g. Ruzmaikin, Sokoloff and Shukurov 1988). Recent, breakthrough in numerical simulations allows for ab-initio models for magnetic field growth in galaxies showing overwhelming evidence by many different groups that magnetic fields in galaxies can be quickly amplified by the small-scale turbulent dynamo on rather short timescale compared to the dynamical time. In Steinwandel et. al. (2019) we studied the magnetic field amplification in Milky Way-like galaxies by means of the small-scale turbulent dynamo in great detail. We evlauted the presence of the small-scale trubulent dynamo by the shape of the magnetic power-spectra that take the predicted slope of k^{3/2} of Kazantsev 1967. Furthermore, we quantified the dynamo for the first time in galaxy simulation by computing the correlation between magnetic field strength and magnetic curvature and find excellent agreement with the high-resolution predcitions from Schkochihin et al. (2004).

### Magnetic field amplifcation in Milky Way-like galaxies II: The large-scale dynamo

In Steinwandel et al. (2020a) we investigated the emergence of the large-scale dynamo after the small-scale turbulent dynamo is saturated in the non-linear regime. That this is actually the case we showed via the change in the magnetic power-spectra at late evolutionary stages of the galactic disc from a Kazantsev k^{3/2} spectrum to an Iroshnikov-spectrum with k^{-3/2} as it is expected in the presence of strong magnetic fields. In order to study the classic large-scale (mean-field) dynamo I computed a rough estimate of the Dynamo control parameters (e.g. Ruzmaikin, Sokoloff and Shukurov 1988) to get an estimate for the strength of the alpha-effect and the the kinetic helicty in my simulations. I was able to show that the dyanmo is supported by large-scsale rotational component that is reordering the field from a dipolar to a quadrupolar structure which I could identify in field reversals at of the radial cimponent and sign changes of the toroidal component above and below the midplane. In combination with my previous owrk I could for the first time deduce the complex interplay between the small-sclae turbulent dynamo and the large dynamo, resulting in an alpha^2-Omega dynamo with a complex three dimesnional magnetic field structure as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, we were able to quantify that the simulations follow observed correlations between star formaion surface rate density and magnetic field strength in excellent agreement with the results of Tabatabei et al (2013) and previously aachieved theroretical work of Schleicher & Beck (2013), which we show in Figure 4.

### Magneto-centrifugal outflows in disc galaxies

In Steinwandel et al. (2020c), I recently proposed a scenario for how magnetic fields could contribute to outflow launching in more massive galaxies based on super-equipartition magnetic fields in the galactic center that are amplified by sheared radial motions in bar formation processes. Therefore, I derived magnetic field growth in galaxies under the assumption of radial flows that originate from dynamical oscillations due to the presence of non-axis symmetric potentials, such as a bar potential. I showed that one can get a zeroth-order net growth of the toroidal component of the central magnetic field by this radial flows. Under the assumption that the alpha^2-Omega dynamo already amplified the field to equipartition field strength one can show that the resulting field can reach low Plasmabeta values of around 0.1 in the galactic center. However, a Plasmabeta of 0.1 alone is not enough to generate an outflow based on magnetic fields. The second crucial part is to provide a field structure with a strong component perpendicular to the galactic disc (i.e. an open field geometry). In mys imulations I find that this can be provided by the fast grwoing modes of the Parker-Instability and I find that the Parker-Instability can lift magnetic field lines up on the same time-scale as the basr is funneling mass towards the center of the galaxy. In combination these two effects can lead to a relatively weak but strongly magnetetized outflow, that is supported by the magnetic pressure from the low beta-regime and the thermal feedback by exploding supernoave. In combination this generates a stronlgly colimated biconal outflow with a mass loading of around 0.05.
Based on my results I suggested that this process might be a mssing link in understanding outflows in larger-scale cosmological volume simulations, epsecially in combination with cosmic-rays (CRs) that are often excluded from galaxy formation recipes. Furthermore, I tested this scenario against the sample of CHANG-ES galaxies as such an outflow process would naturally explanin the X-shaped halo field observed in the sample.
Morevoer, I derived an easy toy-model to evaluate if magnetic-driven outflows could play a role at higher redshift where higher outflow-rates in massive galaxies are very common. Therefore, I assumed simple scaling relations for the magnetic field and the star-formation rate to obtain outflow-rates based on the magnetic field for the star-forming main sequence from Withacker et al. (2014). My easy model predicts that magnetic field could contribute up to 20 per cent to the telat outflow rate in high redhshift galaxies as observed in Foerster-Schreiber et al. (2019).
